 The Processor is a 16-bit RISC CPU with 16-bit Address space with RISC type instructions. The processor is a multi-cycle processor which does fetch, decode, execution, and write stages sequentially in multiple cycles. 
 The processor has an Instruction prefetch register (IPR) available, the output of which goes to instruction register (IR) 
 so that instruction fetch of the next instruction can happen concurrently with the processing of the current instruction.
